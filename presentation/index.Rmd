## Background

Each year an enormous amount of money is spent on creating "Great Hit" movies.

Using a sample dataset of thousands of films, which included the highest budgeted films within a 10 year period (1990-2000), as a relatively recent time period, shows staggering increases in budgets per movie.
This is shown in the calculations below:

```{r, echo=FALSE} 
data_path <- "../data/movies.tab"
movies <- read.table(data_path, sep="\t", header=TRUE, quote="", comment="")
```

```{r}
movies1990 <- movies[movies$year=="1990" ,]
max(movies1990$budget, na.rm = TRUE)

movies2000 <- movies[movies$year=="2000" ,]
max(movies2000$budget, na.rm = TRUE)
```

## Motivation

This leads to a number of questions:

* Does a higher budget increase the movie rating?

* Is movie ratings increasing over the years?

* Is budget increasing year on year?

<br>

The Movies Budget and Ratings Investigation Tool allows the user to investigate these questions for themselves.

 - view the budget spent on a historical film catelog
