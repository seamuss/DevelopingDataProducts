## Welcome to the Movies Budget and Ratings Investigation Tool

<br>
The application gives the user the ability to investigate the correlation between budget spent on a movie and the average movie rating.

This allows them to answer a number of questions, sample questions would be:

* Does a higher budget increase the movie rating?
* Is movie ratings increasing over the years?
* Is bidget increasing year on year?

To examine the data at a more detailed level the user can check/uncheck the genres, and adjust the date range of the movies, from the control panel on the left hand side. The graphs will react according to the selections made. 

The data used in this application is a Movie Data Set, compiled from IMDB ratings. The data, and more information on it, can be found [here](http://had.co.nz/data/movies/). 

Within this application there is the functionality to allow a user to explore the data that is represented in the graphs and assisting them to ansert their questions by going to the Data tab
